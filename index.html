            After WWI, people in Germany became dissatisfied with the government. 
            Germany had lost the war, and because the countries they sided with disbanded, they also received all of the blame. 
            Adding to the people's worries, Germany was experiencing a food shortage and an outbreak of influenza had killed millions. 
            They were also disgruntled because of their neighbor Russia, which was also having a revolution at the time. 
            These events, combined with the Kiel Mutiny, started the revolution.
