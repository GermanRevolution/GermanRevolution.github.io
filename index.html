            After WWI, people in Germany became dissatisfied with the government. 
            Germany had lost the war, and because the countries they sided with disbanded, they also received all of the blame. 
            Adding to the people's worries, Germany was experiencing a food shortage and an outbreak of influenza had killed millions. 
            They were also disgruntled because of their neighbor Russia, which was also having a revolution at the time. 
            These events, combined with the Kiel Mutiny, started the revolution.

            The Kiel Mutiny is the event that started the German revolution. 
            It started at the end of WWI when the Germans wanted to launch one last attack. 
            They wanted to send a small fleet of boats against a great British navy to gain some of the respect back that they lost. 
            The sailors knew that this attack would be a suicide mission so they protested. 
            The generals wanted to go on the last mission and die in glory so they didnâ€™t approve of the protests. 
            The sailors started to not show up to work and left their posts. 
            It eventually ended with the sailors detaining the generals and writing a list of demands:

            1. The release of all inmates and political prisoners.
            2. Complete freedom of speech and the press.
            3. The abolition of mail censorship.
            4. Appropriate treatment of crews by superiors.
            5. No punishment for comrades returning to ships and barracks.
            6. No launching of the fleet under any circumstances
            
            This led to the German people seeing this event and hearing about this event and wanting change, much like the sailors
