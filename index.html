        In 1918, the German Revolution began. Lasting only one year, it failed to bring about any significant long-term changes. Any advancements that were made, however, were quickly revised when Hitler rose to power in 1933.

    <p> 
        After WWI, people in Germany became dissatisfied with the government. 
        Germany had lost the war, and because the countries they sided with disbanded, also received all of the blame. 
        Adding to the people's worries, Germany was experiencing a food shortage and an outbreak of influenza had killed millions. 
        They were also disgruntled because of their neighbor Russia, which was having a revolution at the time. 
        These issues, combined with the Kiel Mutiny, started the revolution.

        The Kiel Mutiny is the event that started the German Revolution. 
        It began at the end of WWI when the Germans wanted to launch one last attack. 
        They wanted to send a small fleet of boats against a great British navy to gain back some respect.
        The generals approved of this; they wanted to go on the mission and die with glory.
        However, the sailors knew that this attack would be a suicide mission -- so they protested by not leaving their posts and not showing up to work. 
        Their mutiny spread until it reached Kiel, and it ended with the sailors detaining the generals and writing a list of demands, including: <br>
        <br>
        1. The release of all inmates and political prisoners. <br>
        2. Complete freedom of speech and the press. <br>
        3. The abolition of mail censorship. <br>
        4. Appropriate treatment of crews by superiors. <br>
        5. No punishment for comrades returning to ships and barracks. <br>
        6. No launching of the fleet under any circumstances <br>
        <br>
        As the German people watched this event transpire, they started to believe that if the sailors could revolt, they could too.

        <br>
        On November 9th, 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated and Friedrich Ebert became the chancellor of Germany. 
        Unhappy with this new government, Karl Liebknect announced the dawn of the Free Republic of Germany. 
        Along with Rosa Luxembourg, he led the Spartacist Party, whose goal was to create a Communist state in Germany. <br>
        <br>
        On January 5th, they gave hundreds of workers weapons and attempted an armed takeover of Berlin. 
        So, Chancellor Ebert organized 3,000 soldiers, called the Friekorps, to fight against them. 
        After three days of fighting, Liebknect and Luxembourg were captured and murdered. 
        Overall, around 1,000 Spartacists and 17 Friekorps were killed. 
        The Spartacists attempted another takeover in April, where most of them were killed; this marked the end of the Spartacist Party.

        The Weimar Republic was the new German government that formed in 1919. 
        It was a Republic and it had a president with terms of seven years. 
        In its constitution, all German citizens had equal rights and all of them over 20 could vote. 
        They were also granted freedom of religion and expression. 
        Furthermore, they were given the right to private property and equal opportunities. 
        However, the Weimar Republic also had a lot of problems. For example: <br>
        <br>
        1. Hyperinflation <br>
        2. Political extremism <br>
        3. Political murders <br>
        4. Two attempted seizures of power <br>
        5. Isolation <br>
        6. Reduced diplomatic standing <br>
        7. Contentious relations with nearby great powers <br>
        8. There were so many political parties that no one could agree on anything <br>
        <br>
        Eventually, the Weimar Republic would be disbanded in 1933 because of Adolf Hitler.

        A temporary republic was established (Council of People’s Ministers or Deputies) in November 1918 and dissolved in February 1919. 
        It was replaced by the Weimar Republic.
        The Kaiser (Wilhelm II) fled for his life leaving Germany and the Monarchies were abolished. 
        The people of Germany received more rights such as freedom of religion and expression as a result of the revolution.
